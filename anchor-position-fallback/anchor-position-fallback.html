        Once upon a time, in the sunny city of Perth, Western Australia, there
        lived a front-end developer named Anton who worked at Doist. Anton had a
        great passion for two things: doughnuts and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anton was preparing for a big conference in Oslo, Norway, where he was
        going to present on the future of CSS. This wasn‚Äôt his first time in
        Oslo; he had been there once before and had fallen in love with the city
        and its people.
      </p>
      <div class="tooltip">A tooltip to display üç©</div>
      <button type="button" class="button anchor">Tell me more</button>
      <p>
        To make his presentation stand out, Anton decided to create a
        doughnut-themed presentation to showcase the power and versatility of
        modern CSS techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he prepared for his journey, Anton made sure to pack his favorite
        doughnut-themed attire: a doughnut-patterned tie, doughnut-print socks,
        and even a doughnut-shaped USB stick containing his presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon arrival in Oslo, Anton was greeted by the familiar sights and
        sounds of the bustling city. He headed straight to his favorite local
        doughnut shop to fuel up for his big presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day of the conference arrived, and Anton confidently stepped onto
        the stage, ready to dazzle the audience with his doughnut-inspired CSS
        creations. As he began to speak, the crowd was immediately captivated by
        the colorful, mouth-watering visuals on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the presentation, Anton demonstrated how CSS could be used to
        create dynamic, responsive designs that resembled various types of
        doughnuts. He showed the audience how to use gradients, animations, and
        even 3D transformations to bring their web designs to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Anton wrapped up his talk, the crowd erupted into applause, praising
        his creativity and ingenuity in incorporating his love for doughnuts
        into his work as a front-end developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        With another successful presentation under his belt, Anton spent the
        rest of his time in Oslo enjoying the local culture and, of course,
        indulging in more delicious doughnuts. He returned to Perth with a
        renewed sense of enthusiasm for his work, eager to continue pushing the
        boundaries of CSS and web design.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, Anton‚Äôs doughnut-themed adventure in Oslo came to an end, but
        his passion for front-end development and doughnuts continued to thrive,
        inspiring others to explore the sweet possibilities of CSS.
